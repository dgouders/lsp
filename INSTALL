ncursesw is readily available on macOS.


BUILDING

    $ meson setup <builddir>
    $ cd <builddir>
    $ meson compile

Where <builddir> denotes the path to the directory that will contain the built
files.

Alternatively, you can specify an install prefix via

    $ meson setup --prefix=<install prefix> <builddir>

in the first step above, with <install prefix> denoting the path into which lsp
will later be installed

Please note: on macOS with homebrew, <install prefix> seems to default to the
homebrew tree. This may later lead to problems, at least to `brew doctor`
complaining. So, consider overriding the prefix. You can check which prefix is
being used via

    $ meson configure <builddir> | grep prefix


INSTALLING

    $ meson install
